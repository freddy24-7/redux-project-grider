# Credits

The code for this project is based on the Steven Grider course [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/).

## Project Structure

The project uses ES modules for importing dependencies and components.

The entry point of the application is the App component, which is rendered by the createRoot function from react-dom/client.

The App component is wrapped in a Provider component from react-redux, which provides the Redux store to all components.

The App component contains a button to reset both playlists and renders the MoviePlaylist and SongPlaylist components.

The MoviePlaylist component displays a list of movies and provides functionality to add and remove movies from the list.

The SongPlaylist component displays a list of songs and provides functionality to add and remove songs from the list.

The Redux store is configured using the configureStore function from @reduxjs/toolkit. It combines the songsReducer and moviesReducer to manage the state for songs and movies.

The songsReducer and moviesReducer are created using the createSlice function from @reduxjs/toolkit. They define the initial state and handle actions to add, remove, and reset the playlists.

The reset action is created using the createAction function from @reduxjs/toolkit. It is used in both reducers to reset the respective playlists.

The createRandomMovie and createRandomSong functions are utility functions that generate random movie and song names using the faker library.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
